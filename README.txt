## Steps
1. Go to the backend repo link, clone and run that app.
2. Go to the frontend repo link, clone and `npm install` & `npm start` the app.
3. Use the app!

## Things we missed due to the time contraint
We completed the backend with full functinality (CRUD Operations, etc).
We also complete the frontend with full visual functionality. Some parts had data hardcoded. These are listed:
- Profile: edit form, delete form
- Profile Payment info: edit form
- Register account: edit form
- Shopping cart: getting correct data from the backend
- Search: search algo, rendering
- Spring Security Config: full security
- Authentication providers, password encryption, jwt tokens, etc
- JUnit and Mock testing
- Heroku live server
